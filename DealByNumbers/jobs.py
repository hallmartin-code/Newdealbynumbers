"""Disk-backed background job store for deck -> one-pager generation.

Why disk and not an in-process dict: Railway runs this app under gunicorn with
multiple workers. The worker that accepts ``POST /generate`` and starts the
background thread is often NOT the worker that later serves ``GET /status/<id>``
or ``GET /download/<id>``. A per-process dict would be invisible to sibling
workers, so a poll could hit a worker that has never heard of the job. The
filesystem is shared by every worker on the instance, so we key job state on it:

    <STORE_DIR>/<job_id>.json   -- status record (processing | ready | error)
    <STORE_DIR>/<job_id>.pdf    -- the rendered document, once ready

The heavy work (extract -> analyze via Claude -> render -> email) runs in a
daemon thread. ``POST /generate`` returns the job id immediately, so the HTTP
request is never held open long enough for Railway's edge proxy to time it out.
The browser then polls the fast ``/status`` endpoint until the job is ready.

Results are ephemeral: they live on the instance's local disk and are swept
after a TTL (and are lost on redeploy/restart). That is fine here -- downloads
happen within seconds/minutes of generation, and every document is also emailed.
